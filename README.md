# UFO Sighting Website

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to make a large an unwieldly database easily accessible by the average user. This datbase in particular focused on UFO sightings in 2010. 

To accomplish this, a website was created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS to make the data easy to search and read.

## How to Use the Website

**General Layout**

This website contains a brief summary of UFO sightings and a searchable database at the bottom. On the bottom left, under "Filter Search" criteria can be entered to filter data. The data is stored on the bottom right and it is defaulted to display all data at once in the database.

Using the search criteria in the bottom left, users can input one or more specifications to filter the data on the right. If the criteria does not exist in the data, no results will populate

Above is an example of what the results will look like when searching for any UFO sightings in Michigan.


## Summary

While this webpage is sufficient, one major drawback is that the searchable criteria is currently case sensitive. The database stores all data in lower-case, thus any searches in upper-case (e.g. "MI" for Michigan) results in no data populating.

Two updates to this site could be:

1. Making the search criteria search for any case and approximate spellings
2. Allow for user inputs to increase the database over time, this will allow for additional trends to be elucidated rather than relying on outdated data from 2010
